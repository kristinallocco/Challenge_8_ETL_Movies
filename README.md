*Columbia Bootcamp 08 Aug 2021*

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to develop a film database which cleaned and transformed movie data from wikipedia, Kaggle, and aggregated ratings. The etxtract, transform, load process was utilized in an effort to first extract data from their respective files, then transform the raw data [cleaning rows, performing joins and formating datatypes] and finally load the cleaned data into an PostgreSQL database.
